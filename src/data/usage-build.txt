cargo-rbext - Cargo subcommand to use Rust from Ruby and vice varsa

Usage: cargo rbext build [options]

    Runs `cargo build --release` internally and copies the
    created cdylib file to the proper name for ruby extension.

    Difference of rust's cdylib name and ruby extension name

       When the crate name is `example`:
         platform: cdylib name      -->  ruby extension name
         Windows:  example.dll      -->  example.so
         macOS:    libexample.dylib -->  example.bundle
         Others:   libexample.so    -->  example.so

Options:

    All options are passed to `cargo build` as they are.
