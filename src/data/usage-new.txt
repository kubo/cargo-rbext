cargo-rbext - Cargo subcommand to use Rust from Ruby and vice varsa

Usage: cargo rbext new [options] <path>

    When the `--lib` option is specified, this command
    executes `cargo new` internally and then modifies
    `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` and adds some files.

    Otherwise, it executes `cargo new` internally and then
    modifies `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs`.

Options:

     All `cargo new` options are acceptable. They are passed
     to `cargo new` as they are except the following case.

     When both `--lib` and `--name <NAME>` are specified, <NAME>
     is used as a ruby extention name. The last file name part
     only is passed to the `cargo new` command.

        Example:
          cargo new-rosy --lib --name foo/bar baz
          => cargo new --lib --name bar baz
